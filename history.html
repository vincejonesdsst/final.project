			<p class="paragraph">The OKC Thunder are currently in a rebuilding phase after losing their all star player, Kevin Durant, to free agency. They are now centered around Russell Westbrook who put up amazing numbers last year.
			Russ averaged a tripple double and broke the record for most triple doubles in a season. This team has struggled in the post season but even without their franchise player they continue to compete and will try to bring a trophy back home to Oklahoma. There has been a lot of talk around Russell leaving the thunder in hopes of playing with a more competetive team but Westbrook has reassured the organization that he is in for the long run and plans to sign a long term deal with the team</p>
