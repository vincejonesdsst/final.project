    You were noble enough to sacrifice your own life in order to protect the greater good. You battle the ghost.. ghost on ghost action.. you get a couple
  good hits in but you start getting beat up because the ghost can throw hands. You are desperate for
victory and you throw a rock at the ghost so that at you can win </p>
